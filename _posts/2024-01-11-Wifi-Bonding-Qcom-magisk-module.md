## Introduction

Slow and unreliable WiFi connectivity is a common annoyance faced by many Android users. Wifi Bonding Qcom offers an innovative solution to enhance your wireless experience - it bonds multiple WiFi networks together for faster speeds and greater stability. This Magisk module unleashes the hidden WiFi bonding capability in Qualcomm chipsets. 

## How WiFi Bonding Works

Your phone can only use one WiFi network at a time by default. Wifi Bonding allows combining bandwidth from different networks simultaneously. Data is split across the bonded links. This doubles or even triples the available bandwidth for blazing fast speeds. The module also provides greater signal reliability by switching connections seamlessly if one drops.

## Key Features

- Bonds available 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands into one fast network
- Combine multiple public WiFi hotspots for on-the-go use
- Seamless switching between links for reliable connectivity 
- Compatible with Qualcomm devices only

## Faster Downloads and Streaming

Wifi Bonding makes the most of all available networks for lightning quick downloads. HD video streaming and large file transfers will complete in a fraction of the usual time. Online multiplayer gaming also benefits from lower latency and reduced lag spikes. The module is a must-have for taking advantage of multiple public hotspots.
