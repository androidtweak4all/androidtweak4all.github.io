## Introduction
Slow graphics rendering and lagging performance are common problems faced by many Android users. A cluttered graphics cache can significantly affect your device's speed and responsiveness. Godspeed GPU Cache Cleaner offers a simple solution - it's a Magisk module that cleans the graphics cache to boost gaming performance and overall system speed. 

##Why Use a GPU Cache Cleaner?

The graphics cache stores rendered images, textures, and other graphical data to optimize gaming and app performance. Over time, it can get overloaded with unnecessary junk files that clog up your system's memory. Manually wiping the cache requires root access. Godspeed GPU Cache Cleaner module gives you an easy way to wipe graphics cache and free up space with a few taps.

## Key Features

- Requires Magisk root 
- Small size module for minimal overhead
- Options to clear cache for Adreno, Mali, PowerVR, etc. GPUs
- Automate cache clearing with custom intervals
- Monitor cache size from app

## Improving Gaming Performance 

Cleaning the GPU cache forces the graphics processor to reload textures, shaders and other assets instead of using old cached versions. This can fix graphical glitches, texture pop-in and stuttering in games. Godspeed is especially useful for older devices to reclaim performance.
